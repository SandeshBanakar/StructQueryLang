Hello!
Welcome to the SQL files section. This repository has a full fledged database named Chinook.db

The files after that are queries and has comments to make you understand how the code works.

Whenever you have an error that says "Failes to push some refs to --Repo Name--", add these codes
to initializes the folder with the GitHub repository.

Anytime you need to push the new files, it can be done from a simple <git push> command.

Here is the code:
<git pull --rebase origin main>
<git push origin main>

This means that any new repository created will have files in the <main> branch and not <master>

This allows the GitHub and Git to control the codes from the main branch.
